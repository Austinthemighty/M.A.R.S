    <h1>About</h1>

    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>We come from all sorts of walks of life, some of us are masters in astrophysics, others in latin and medieval poetry who wanted to work at NASA to preform experiments
    but didn't make the cut so managing a system to allow reservations for experiments was the next best thing to do. We came together one nght in a coffee shop and decided to
    launch the Martian Astro Reservation System (M.A.R.S.) We are licensed with NASA and SpaceEx, we are committed to helping people get a quick and convenient reservation
    service for their trip to mars</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What we do</h2>
    <p>We provide convenient, quick and easy reservations to the red planet, allowing you to reserve your spot on mars to conduct whatever experiments you want.
        Our reservation service has 0 registered complaints so far, and we are commited to keeping that number at 0 by fitting all your reservational and scientific
        needs.
