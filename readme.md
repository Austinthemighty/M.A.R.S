Purpose of our project:

  To reserve an area on mars for people who want to do experiments on the martian land or atmosphere.
  We do not send you to mars rather we set up the launch time for sponsors such as NASA and Space X who will send you to
 mars.

Area of interest:

  Our favorite part of the web site would be our nav bar, we made it highlight when ever you hover your mouse icon over
 any section of the bar.  Also make sure to check out the cookies.
